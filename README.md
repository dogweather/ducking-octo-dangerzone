# Repo Health Check

Analyze a project: Is it well managed? Does it want help? **Does it _accept_
help?**

[The Issues](https://github.com/dogweather/repo-health-check/issues) show the
development roadmap. Brainstorming is [happening on the
wiki](https://github.com/dogweather/ducking-octo-dangerzone/wiki).
